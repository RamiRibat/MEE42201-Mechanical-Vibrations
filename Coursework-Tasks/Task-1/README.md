# Modeling and simulation of vibrations for a bus, with Passive suspension system â€“ a Python approach.

In this work, a simple bus is modeled as a half-car model of two dynamics,
longitudinal and lateral. Vibrations response to a road disturbance is plotted
using python and results been discussed.
