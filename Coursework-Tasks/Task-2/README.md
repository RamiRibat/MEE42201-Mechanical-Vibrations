# Vibration Analysis and Control of Building Subjected to Wind and Seismic Waves.

In this work, a simple two models of a building is considered. In both models the
response due to wind waves and seismic waves is analyzed and reduced to a comfortable
level using different techniques. Then a generalized response is been given. The results was
shown and comments been given on it.
